Task
A variable with the value undefined can be created by assigning the value undefined to it. 
Create a variable named name and assign it the value undefined. Create a variable named typeOfName and assign it a value of type name.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let salary = undefined;
const typeOfSalary = typeof salary;

Solution
let name = undefined;
const typeOfName = typeof name;
