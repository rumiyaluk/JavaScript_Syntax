Task
Is there any information on academic performance in mathematics? 
(Checking the existence of an object property with "key" in obj)
The object stores information about the student's marks: const report = {'math': 5, 'history': 4, 'science': 5,}
Determine if the object stores information about math performance. The result must be true or false. 
In other words, does the report object have a property named math.
To complete the task, create a report object as described above. 
Then set a variable named hasMath and assign it the value: 'math' in report, which will be true if the report object contains a math property, and false otherwise.


Solution
const report = {'math': 5, 'history': 4, 'science': 5,}
const hasMath = 'math' in report;
