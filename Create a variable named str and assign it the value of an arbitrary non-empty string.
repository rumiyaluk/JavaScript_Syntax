Task
Create a variable named str and assign it the value of an arbitrary non-empty string. Create a variable firstSymbol and 
assign it the value of the first character of the string (i.e. the character with index 0).
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:

Solution
const str = 'Mary';
const firstSymbol = str [0];
