Task
Is it true that the given number is even?
A number is even if the remainder of dividing that number by 2 is 0. Create a variable num and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. 
Create a variable isEven and assign to it the result of comparing the remainder of num divided by 2 with zero, which will be true if num is an even number, or false otherwise.

Solution
const num = 2;
const isEven = num % 2 === 0;
