Task
The USA is divided into 50 states. Your job is to list the states that start with the letter "C".
Create variables cState1, cState2 and cState3 and give them the names of states that start with the letter "C": 'California', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut'.
Create a variable threeCStates that will concatenate the three variables separated by commas into one line.

Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const hCar1 = 'Honda';
const hCar2 = 'Hummer';
const hCar3 = 'Hyundai';
const threeHCars = hCar1 + ',' + hCar2 + ',' + hCar3;

Solution
const cState1 = 'California';
const cState2 = 'Colorado';
const cState3 = 'Connecticut';
const threeCStates = cState1 + ',' + cState2 + ',' + cState3;
