Given the age of the person. Is the person an adult?
In many countries, the age of majority is 18. Create a variable age and assign it the value of an arbitrary positive number 
(the person's age). Create a variable isAdult and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the age is greater than or equal to 18 and false otherwise.

Solution
const age = 20;
const isAdult = age >= 18;
