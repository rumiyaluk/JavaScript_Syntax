Task
Is it true that the given numbers a and b are equal?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. Create a variable areEqual and assign it the result of 
a strict comparison between a and b, so that areEqual is true if a is b, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 3;
const b = 10;
const areEqual = a === b;
