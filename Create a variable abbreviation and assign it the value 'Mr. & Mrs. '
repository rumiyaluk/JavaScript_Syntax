Task
Create a variable abbreviation and assign it the value 'Mr. & Mrs. '
Create a second variable lastName and assign it the value 'Smith'.
Create a third variable familyName and assign it the value obtained by adding the abbreviation, space and lastName variables
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const firstName = 'Ivan';
const lastName = 'Ivanov';
const name = firstName + '' + lastName;

Solution
const abbreviation = 'Mr. & Mrs. ';
const lastName = 'Smith';
const familyName = abbreviation + '' + lastName;
