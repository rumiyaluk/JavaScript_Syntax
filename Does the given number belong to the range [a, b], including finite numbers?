Task
Does the given number belong to the range [a, b], including finite numbers?
The number x belongs to the interval [a, b] if the following condition is satisfied: x >= a && x <= b.
Create a variable x and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers (a < b) to them.
Create a variable isBelongs and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if x belongs to the given interval [a, b] or false otherwise.

Solution
const x = 5;
const a = 3;
const b = 7;
const isBelongs = x >= a && x <= b;
