Task
Fourth coordinate quarter
Given a point with coordinates (x, y). Is it true that the point is in the fourth coordinate quadrant? 
The point (x, y) belongs to the fourth coordinate quadrant if x > 0 and y < 0.
Create variables x and y and assign arbitrary number values to them. 
Create a variable isForth and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if x > 0 and y < 0, or false otherwise.

Solution
const x = 3;
const y = -5;
const isForth = x > 0 && y < 0;
