Task
Create a variable month and assign it any number from 1 to 12.
Create a second variable, day, and assign it any number between 1 and 31.
Create a third variable, year, and assign any four-digit number to it.
Create a fourth variable, date, which will concatenate the first three variables into one line (make sure all variables are separated from each other with a "/").
An example of a date in US format: mm / dd / yyyy (month / day / year).
Create a fifth variable, dateLength, which will show the length of the date variable.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const hours = 1;
const minutes = 24;
const seconds = 2020;
const combinedString = hours + ':' + minutes + ':' + seconds;
const lengthOfCombinedString = combinedString.length;

const month = 8;
const day = 27;
const year = 1978;
const date = day + '/' + month + '/' + year;
const dateLength = date.length;
