Task
Given an arbitrary number. Determine if it is a positive three-digit number, i.e. a number from 100 to 999.
Create a variable number and assign it the value of an arbitrary integer. 
Create a variable isThreeDigitPositive and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true 
if the number is between 100 and 999 inclusive, and false otherwise.
Solution
const number = 356;
const isThreeDigitPositive = number >= 100 && number <= 999;
