A non-negative number is a number whose value is greater than or equal to 0. 
Create a variable num and assign it a value of an arbitrary number. Create a variable isNonNegative and assign it the result of comparing num to zero, 
which will be true if num is non-negative, or false otherwise.

Solution
const num = 5;
const isNonNegative = num> = 0;
