Task
Create a stringStart variable and assign it the value 'Welcome to our class'.
Create a variable stringEnd and assign the value 'John Smith' to it.
Create a newString variable that will be the result of merging the stringStart variable and the stringEnd variable with a space between them.

Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let name = 'Paul';
let surname = 'Smith';
let fullName = name + '' + surname;

Solution
let stringStart = 'Welcome to our class';
let stringEnd = 'John Smith';
let newString = stringStart + '' + stringEnd;
