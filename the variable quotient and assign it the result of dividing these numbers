Task
Set the variables a and b and assign them the values of strings containing arbitrary numbers.
Set the variable quotient and assign it the result of dividing these numbers, first converting the strings to numbers.
Those. for example, the result '20' / '5' should be 4.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const a = '5';
const b = '10';

Solution
const quotient = + a / + b;
