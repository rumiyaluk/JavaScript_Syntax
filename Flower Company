Task 
Flower Company
Two shops owned by a flower company sold tulips, but at different prices. 
Objects store information on how many tulips and at what price each store sold. Find the total amount of money the firm received from the sale of flowers.
shop1 = {count: 900, price: 1.4,}
shop2 = {count: 1200, price: 1.3,}
Create objects as above and also a variable called total, in which you will calculate the total amount of money received from the sale.

Solution
const shop1 = {count: 900, price: 1.4,}
const shop2 = {count: 1200, price: 1.3,}
const total = shop1.count * shop1.price + shop2.count * shop2.price;
