Task
Set the variables a and b and assign them the values of strings containing arbitrary numbers.
Set the variable difference and assign it the result of subtracting numbers (subtract b from a), first converting the strings to numbers. 
Those. for example, the result '5' - '3' should be 2.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const num1 = '13';
const num2 = '15';
const result = + num1 - + num2;

Solution
const a = '5';
const b = '10';
const difference = + a - + b;
