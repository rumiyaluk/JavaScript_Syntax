Task
Doesn't the sum change from the change of places of the terms?
Set the variable a and assign it the string value '2'. Set the variable b and assign it the string value '3'.
Set the variable aPlusB and assign it the result of the merge of variables a and b. Set the variable bPlusA and assign it the result of the merge of variables b and a.
Set the variable isEqual and assign it the result of comparing the variables aPlusB and bPlusA.

Solution

const a = '2';
const b = '3';
const aPlusB = a + b;
const bPlusA = b + a;
const isEqual = aPlusB === bPlusA;
