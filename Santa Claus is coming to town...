Santa Claus is coming to town...
Given the number of the month and the number of the day. If month is 12 and day is 24, get the message "Santa Claus is coming to town", 
or "Santa Claus is still making gifts", otherwise.
Create a month variable and assign it an arbitrary integer value between 1 and 12. 
Create a day variable and assign an arbitrary integer value between 1 and 31 to it. Create a message variable. Using the if-else command, get the value in the message variable: "Santa Claus is coming to town" if the month is 12 and the day is 24, and "Santa Claus is still making gifts" otherwise.

const month = 12;
const day = 24;

if (month === 12 && day === 24) {message = 'Santa Claus is coming to town';} else {message = 'Santa Claus is still making gifts';}
