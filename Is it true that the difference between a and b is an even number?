Task
Is it true that the difference between a and b is an even number?
A number is even if the remainder of dividing that number by 2 is 0. Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. 
Create a variable isDifferenceEven and assign it the result of checking if the difference between these numbers is an even number. 
Those. the variable isDifferenceEven will be true if a - b is an even number, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 18;
const b = 8;
const isDifferenceEven = (a - b) % 2 === 0;
