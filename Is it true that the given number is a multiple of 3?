task
Is it true that the given number is a multiple of 3?
A number is a multiple of 3 if the remainder of that number divided by 3 is 0. 
Create a variable num and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. Create a variable isDividedBy3 and assign to it the result of 
comparing the remainder of num divided by 3 with zero, which will be true if num is a multiple of 3 or false otherwise.

Solution
const num = 12;
const isDividedBy3 = num % 3 === 0;
