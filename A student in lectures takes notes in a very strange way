Task
A student in lectures takes notes in a very strange way: he shortens each word, leaving only the first and last letters, 
and puts a dash between them. Thus, for example, from the word "function" is obtained "f-i". You have to set an arbitrary word and write it down in the way the student uses.
Create a variable word and assign it the value of an arbitrary string. 
Create a variable cut, assign it the value of the result of the concatenation of the first letter, dash and last letter.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const name = 'Moscow';
const shortName = name [0] + '.';

Solution
const word = 'Muscat';
const cut = word [0] + '-' + word [word.length -1];
