Temperature in the other hemisphere
If in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter, then in the Southern Hemisphere it is summer. 
If, say, in Russia, the frost is -30 degrees, then in Australia it can be hot, and the temperature is 30 degrees above zero.
To solve the problem:
Set the temp variable and assign an arbitrary number to it. Set the variable opposite and assign the opposite sign value to the variable temp.
Solution
const temp = 10;
const opposite = -temp;
