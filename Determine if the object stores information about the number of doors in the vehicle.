Task
Determine if the object stores information about the number of doors in the vehicle. 
The result must be true or false. In other words, does the car object have a property named doors.
To complete the task, create a car object as described above. Then set a variable named hasInfoDoors and assign it a value using the hasOwnProperty () method, 
which is true if the car object contains a doors property, and false otherwise.

Solution
const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
const hasInfoDoors = car.hasOwnProperty ('doors');
