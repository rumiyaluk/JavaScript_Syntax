Task
First coordinate quarter
The French mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650) suggested specifying the position of a point on a plane using two coordinates. 
The abscissa axis "Ox" is the horizontal axis. The y-axis is the vertical axis.
The coordinate axes divide the plane into 4 angles, which are called coordinate quarters. 
The quarter formed by the positive semiaxes (upper right corner) is considered the first (I). 
The point (x, y) belongs to the first coordinate quadrant if x > 0 and y > 0.
Given a point with coordinates (x, y). Is it true that the point is in the first coordinate quadrant?
Create variables x and y and assign arbitrary number values ​​to them. 
Create a variable isFirst and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if x and y are positive, or false otherwise.

Solution
const x = 5;
const y = 7;
const isFirst = x > 0 && y > 0;
