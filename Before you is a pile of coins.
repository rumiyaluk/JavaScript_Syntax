Task
Before you is a pile of coins. Some of them are American cents, others, similar to them in appearance, are Russian pennies. 
You need to count the number of cent coins. When you take a coin, you see if it is a cent (true), and if so, add 1 in your head.
Set the variable coin and set it to true. Set the variable value and assign it the value of coin, converted to a number using the unary plus operation.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const s = true;
const x = + s; // 1

Solution
const coin = true;
const value = + coin;
