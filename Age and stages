Task
Age and stages
Set the variable age and assign it a non-negative value (the person's age). 
Set the stage variable. Using a sequence of nested if-else statements, get the stage variable to: "baby" if age <= 1, "toddler" if age <= 3, "preschooler" if age <= 5, "gradeschooler" if age <= 12, "teen" if age <= 18, "young adult" if age <= 21. "adult", otherwise.

SOLUTION
const age = 10;
let stage;
if (age <= 1) {stage = 'baby';}
else if (age <= 3) {stage = 'toddler';}
else if (age <= 5) {stage = 'preschooler';}
else if (age <= 12) {stage = 'gradeschooler';}
else if (age <= 18) {stage = 'teen';}
else if (age <= 21) {stage = 'young adult';}
