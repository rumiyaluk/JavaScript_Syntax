Task
Third coordinate quarter
Given a point with coordinates (x, y). Is it true that the point is in the third coordinate quadrant? 
The point (x, y) belongs to the third coordinate quadrant if x < 0 and y < 0.
Create variables x and y and assign arbitrary number values to them. Create a variable isThird and assign it a boolean expression,
which will be true if x < 0 and y < 0, or false otherwise.
Solution
const x = 15;
const y = 25;
const isThird = x < 0 && y < 0;
