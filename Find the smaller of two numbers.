Task
Find the smaller of two numbers.
You are given two numbers x and y. Set the variable min to a smaller number.
Create variables x and y and assign arbitrary number values to them. 
Create a min variable. Write an if - else command in which If the condition (x < y) is true, assign the value x to the min variable, otherwise assign the value y to the min variable.

Solution
const x = 2;
const y = 4;
let min;
if (x < y) {min = x;} else {min = y;}
