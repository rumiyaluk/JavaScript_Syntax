Task
In a right-angled triangle, there are two legs a and b. Find its area.
Set the variable a and assign it the value of an arbitrary non-negative number (first leg).
Set the variable b and assign it the value of an arbitrary non-negative number (second leg).
Set the variable area, in which calculate the area of ​​the triangle (half the product of the legs).
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const x = 3;
const y = 5;
const z = x * y / 2;
Write your solution hereunit
Run
  Solution
1const a = 3;
2const b = 5;
3const area = a * b / 2;
