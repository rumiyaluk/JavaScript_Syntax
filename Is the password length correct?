Task
Is the password length correct?
When registering on the site, you must come up with a password with a length of at least 8 characters, 
but no more than 20 characters. Would password be suitable for this purpose?
Create a password variable and assign it an arbitrary string value.
Create an isPasswordCorrect variable and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the password 
is between 8 and 20 characters inclusive, and false otherwise.

Solution
const password = 'alphabet';
const isPasswordCorrect = password.length >= 8 && password.length <= 20;
