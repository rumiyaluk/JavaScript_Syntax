Task
Is it true that a is five times larger than b?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. Create a variable isAFiveTimesB and assign to it the result of comparing variables a and b, 
so that isAFiveTimesB will be true if a is five times greater than b, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 25;
const b = 5;
const isAFiveTimesB = a === b * 5;
