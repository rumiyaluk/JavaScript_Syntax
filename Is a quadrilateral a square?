Task
Is a quadrilateral a square?
A square is a rectangle whose sides are equal. Given the lengths of the sides a, 
b and the angle angle between them. Determine if a quadrilateral is a square? A quadrilateral is a square if a = b and the angle is 90 degrees.
Create variables a, b, and angle and assign arbitrary positive numbers to them. 
Create a variable isSquare and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if a = b and angle = 90, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 5;
const angle = 50;
const isSquare = a === b && b === 50;
