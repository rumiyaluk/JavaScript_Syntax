Task 
The strange language of the natives
The language of the natives from a certain tribe consists of words 4 letters long, and all words begin and end with the same letter. "amba", 
"itli", "uggu" - these are some words from their vocabulary. Determine if the given word can be included in the dictionary of this tribe?
Create a word variable and assign it the value of an arbitrary string (word). Create an isCorrect variable and assign 
it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the word is 4 characters long and the first letter of the word is equal to the last letter, and false otherwise.

Solution
constword = 'Alla';
const isCorrect = word.length === 4 && word[0] === word[word.length -1];
