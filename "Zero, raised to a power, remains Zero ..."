Task
"Zero, raised to a power, remains Zero ..." (poet Stanislav Jerzy Lec)
Create a variable named zero and set it to null. Create a variable named power and assign it the power of zero to the variable zero. 
Create a variable named type and set it to the type of the variable power.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const money = null;
const extraMoney = money ** 2;
const type = typeof extraMoney;

Solution
const zero = null;
const power = zero ** 2;
const type = typeof power;
