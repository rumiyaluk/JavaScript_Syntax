Task
Samantha was 13 years old, but she really wanted to go to the cinema, where she was allowed only from the age of 16, and she added 3 to her age.
Set the value for the age variable and assign it the value of 13. Then write a command to increase the value of the age variable by 3.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let number = 8;
number + = 5;

Solution
let age = 13;
age + = 3;
