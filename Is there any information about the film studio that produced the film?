Task 
Is there any information about the film studio that produced the film? 
(Checking the existence of an object property by converting to a boolean type using a double "not": !!)
The object stores information about the movie: const movie = {'name': 'Groundhog day', 'type': 'comedy', 'year': 1993,}
Determine if the object stores information about which movie studio shot the movie. The result must be true or false. 
In other words, does the movie object have a property named studio.
To complete the task, create a movie object as described above. 
Then set a variable named hasStudioInfo and assign it the result of converting the 'studio' property to a boolean type using the double not (!!).

Solution
const movie = {'name': 'Groundhog day', 'type': 'comedy', 'year': 1993,}
const hasStudioInfo = !! movie.studio;
