Task
Denomination is a change in the face value of money. Usually expressed in "cutting" a certain number of zeros from old banknotes and 
issuing new money of a smaller denomination into circulation.
Suppose a denomination took place in a certain country, and one zero was removed from the notes. Set the variable money and set it to 1000. 
Then write a command that decreases the value of the money variable by 10 times.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let number = 30;
number / = 10;

Solution
let money = 1000;
money / = 10;
