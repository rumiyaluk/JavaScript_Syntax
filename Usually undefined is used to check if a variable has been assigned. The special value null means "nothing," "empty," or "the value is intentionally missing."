Task
Usually undefined is used to check if a variable has been assigned. The special value null means "nothing," "empty," or "the value is intentionally missing."
Create a variable named home and assign undefined to it. Create a variable named money and set it to null. 
Create a variable named isNullEqualsUndefined and assign it the result of strict equality between home and money.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let salary = undefined;
let job = null;
let comparison = salary === job;
Solution
let home = undefined;
let money = null;
let isNullEqualsUndefined = home === money;
