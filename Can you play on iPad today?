Task
Can you play on iPad today?
You have very strict parents who have made a rule that you can only play on the tablet if you pass the math score and complete all your homework.
Create a grade variable and set it to true (grade is fair) or false (grade is poor).
Create a variable isHomeworkDone and set it to true (all homework completed) or false (homework not completed).
Create a variable canIPlay and assign it a condition for checking access to the tablet.
Solution
const grade = true;
const isHomeworkDone = true;
const canIPlay = grade && isHomeworkDone;
