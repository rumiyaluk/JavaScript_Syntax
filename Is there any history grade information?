Task 
Is there any history grade information? (Checking the existence of an object property with "key" in obj)
The object stores information about the student's marks: const report = {'math': 5, 'history': 4, 'science': 5,}
Determine if the object stores historical grade information. The result must be true or false. In other words, 
does the report object have a property named history.
To complete the task, create a report object as described above. Then set a variable named hasHistory and set it to 'history' in report, 
which will be true if the report object contains a history property, and false otherwise.

Solution
const report = {'math': 5, 'history': 4, 'science': 5,}
const hasHistory = 'history' in report;
