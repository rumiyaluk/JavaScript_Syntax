Task
There are 30 children in the class. The third part of all children are girls.
Create a variable kids with a value of 30. Create a girls variable to calculate the number of girls in the class. 
Create a variable boys to calculate the number of boys in the class.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const a = 30;
const b = a / 3;
const c = a - b;
Solution
const kids = 30;
const girls = kids / 3;
const boys = kids - girls;
