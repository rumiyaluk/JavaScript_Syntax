Task
Problem Is there a "b" in the word? (Checking the existence of object properties by converting to a boolean type using a Boolean object)
When counting the number of different letters in a certain word, an object was formed: const obj = {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'z': 3,}
Determine if the letter "b" is in the word. The result must be true or false. In other words, does the object have properties named b.
To complete the task, create an obj object as described above. Then set a variable named propertyB and assign it the result of converting

Solution
const obj = {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'z': 3,};
const propertyB = Boolean (obj.b);
