Task
Create a variable named zero and set it to null.
Create a variable typeOfZero and assign it a value of type zero.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const number = 12.9;
const typeOfNumber = typeof number;


Solution
const zero = null;
const typeOfZero = typeof zero;
