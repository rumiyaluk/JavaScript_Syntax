Task
JavaScript uses "alphabetical" or "lexicographic" order to determine if one string is larger than another. 
In other words, strings are compared character by character. 
The comparison stops and returns a result as soon as the character in one string is not equal to the character in the other string. 
Only if all characters in both strings are identical are the strings equal.
Create variables named a and b and assign arbitrary string values ​​to them.
Create a variable named isABiggerThanB and assign the result of comparing variables a and b to it. 
The variable isABiggerThanB must be true if a> b and false otherwise.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const x = 'son';
const y = 'dad';
const comparison = x> y;

const a = 'Sam';
const b = 'Den';
const comparison = a> b;
const isABiggerThanB = comparison;
