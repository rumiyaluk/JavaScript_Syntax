Task
In a right-angled triangle, there are two legs a and b. Find the hypotenuse with.
Set the variable a and assign it the value of an arbitrary non-negative number (first leg).
Set the variable b and assign it the value of an arbitrary non-negative number (second leg).
Set the variable c in which to calculate the hypotenuse (square root of the sum of the squares of the legs).
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const x = 3;
const y = 5;
const z = (x ** 2 + y ** 2) ** 0.5;

Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 8;
const c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5;
