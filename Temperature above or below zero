Task
Temperature above or below zero
The air temperature is known (in degrees Celsius). Get the message "The temperature is above zero" or "The temperature is below zero".
Create a variable temperature and assign it a value of an arbitrary number. 
Create a message variable. Using the if-else command, get the value in the message variable: "The temperature is above zero" if the temperature is above or equal to zero, and "The temperature is below zero" otherwise.

Solution
const temperature = 15;
let message;
if (temperature > 0 || temperature < 0) {message = 'The temperature is above zero';} else {message = 'The temperature is below zero';}
