Task
Is it true that the given number is a negative three-digit number?
Given an arbitrary number. Determine if it is true that this is a negative three-digit number, i.e. a number between -999 and -100.
Create a variable number and assign 
it the value of an arbitrary integer. 
Create a variable isThreeDigitNegative and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true 
if the number is between -999 and -100 inclusive, and false otherwise.

Solution
const number = -450;
const isThreeDigitNegative = number >= -999 && number <= -100;
