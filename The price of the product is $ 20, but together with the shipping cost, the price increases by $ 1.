Task
The price of the product is $ 20, but together with the shipping cost, the price increases by $ 1.
Set the variable price and assign it a value of 20. Then write a command to increment the value of the price variable by 1.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let number = 8;
number ++;

Solution
let price = 20;
price++;
Task
let price = 10;
price--;
