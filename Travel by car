Task
Travel by car
Create a trip object with the following properties: milesPerDay with a value of 400 (miles per day), days with a value of 5 (number of travel days), 
gallonsPerMile with a value of 0.02 (fuel consumption per mile).
Set the variable totalMiles to calculate the total distance traveled. Set the variable totalGallons to calculate the gallons of fuel consumed.

Solution
const trip = {'milesPerDay': 400, 'days': 5, 'gallonsPerMile': 0.02,};
const totalMiles = trip.milesPerDay * trip.days;
const totalGallons = totalMiles * trip.gallonsPerMile;
