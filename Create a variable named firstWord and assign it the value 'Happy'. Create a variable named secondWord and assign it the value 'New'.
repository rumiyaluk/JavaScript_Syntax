Task
Create a variable named firstWord and assign it the value 'Happy'. Create a variable named secondWord and assign it the value 'New'. 
Create a variable named thirdWord and assign it the value 'Year'. Create a variable named greeting and assign it the result of merging the three specified variables 
with a space between them and an exclamation mark at the end.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const firstName = 'Anthony';
const lastName = 'Smith';
const fullName = firstName + '' + lastName;

Solution
const firstWord = 'Happy';
const secondWord = 'New';
const thirdWord = 'Year';
const greeting = firstWord + '' + secondWord + '' + thirdWord + '!';
