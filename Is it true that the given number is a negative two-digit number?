Task
Is it true that the given number is a negative two-digit number?
Given an arbitrary number. Determine if it is a negative two-digit number, i.e. a number from -99 to -10.
Create a variable number and assign it the value of an arbitrary integer. 
Create a variable isTwoDigitNegative and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the number is between -99 and -10 inclusive, and false otherwise.

Solution
const number = -55;
const isTwoDigitNegative = number >= -99 && number <= -10;
