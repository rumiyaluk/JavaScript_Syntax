Is it possible to add two numbers, represented as strings, and get the correct result?
Set the variable a and assign it the value of a string containing an arbitrary number, for example, '8'.
Set the variable b and assign it the value of a string containing an arbitrary number, for example, '12'.
Set the variable sum and assign it the result of adding these numbers.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const redBalls = '13';
const greenBalls = '15';
const balls = + redBalls + + greenBalls;

Solution
const a = '8';
const b = '12';
const sum = + a + + b;
