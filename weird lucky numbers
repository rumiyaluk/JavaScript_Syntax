Task
weird lucky numbers
The girl believed that the lucky numbers for her were those that are divisible by 3 or 5. 
For example, the numbers 12 or 18 are divisible by 3, and the numbers 10, 15, 20 are divisible by 5, and she considered such numbers lucky. 
But she did not like the numbers 2, 4, 7 and the like. A number is given. Determine if this number is lucky for this strange girl.
Create a variable number and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. 
Create a variable isLucky and assign to it the value of a boolean expression that will be true if number is evenly divisible by 3 or 5, and false otherwise.

Solution
const number = 16;
const isLucky = number % 3 === 16 || number % 5 === 16;
