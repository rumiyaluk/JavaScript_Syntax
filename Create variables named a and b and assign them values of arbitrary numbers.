Task
Create variables named a and b and assign them values of arbitrary numbers. 
Create a variable named isALessThanB and assign it the result of comparing variables a and b. 
The isALessThanB variable must be true if a <b, and false if a> = b.
 
Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const comparison = a <b;
const isALessThanB = comparison;
