Task
Every Christmas, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) tracks Santa Claus with its advanced surveillance technology, 
and then shares this vital information in real time with the NORAD Santa Tracker.
Based on flight profile data collected over 50 years of radar and satellite tracking, 
NORAD concludes that Santa is probably about 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs about 260 pounds (before the cookie). Find Santa's weight in kilograms if 1 pound = 0.453592 kg.
To solve the problem:
Set the variable pound and assign it the value 0.453592.
Set the variable weight and set it to 260 (weight in pounds).
Set the variable weightKg to calculate Santa's weight in kilograms.
(Note: 1 lb = 0.453592 kg)

Solution
const pound = 0.453592;
const weight = 260;
const weightKg = weight * pound;
