Task
Is it true that the given number is a positive two-digit number?
Given an arbitrary number. Determine if it is a positive two-digit number, i.e. number from 10 to 99.
Create a variable number and assign it the value of an arbitrary integer. 
Create a variable isTwoDigitPositive and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the number is between 10 and 99 inclusive, and false otherwise.
Solution
const number = 55;
const isTwoDigitPositive = number >= 10 && number <= 99;
