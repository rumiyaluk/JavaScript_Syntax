Task
An all familiar with a 5-point mark of marks: numbers from 1 to 5. 
But with the introduction of a 10-point system, all marks increased by 2 times. For example, 5 became a dozen, 4 - eight, etc.
Set the SCORE variable and assign it to 5. Then write the command that increases the value of the SCORE variable by 2 times.
Let us give an example that is fundamentally similar to what you need to do, but adapt it to the requirements of the problem:
Let Number = 3;
Number * = 2;

Let score = 5;
score * = 2;
