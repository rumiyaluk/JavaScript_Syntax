Task
Is it true that the point with coordinates (x, y belongs to) one of the coordinate axes?
The point with coordinates (x, y) lies on one of the coordinate axes if x = 0 or y = 0.
calculate the variables x and y and assign them the state values of numbers. 
set up the isBelongToAxes variable and give it a boolean value that will be true if x = 0 or y = 0 and false in this case.
Solution
constant x = 5;
constant y = 10;
const isBelongToAxes = x === 0 || y === 0;
