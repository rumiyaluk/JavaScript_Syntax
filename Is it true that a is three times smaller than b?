Task
Is it true that a is three times smaller than b?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. Create a variable isALessThanB and assign to it the result of comparing variables a and b, so that isALessThanB is true if a is exactly three times less than b, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 15;
const isALessThanB = a * 3 === b;
