Is the number non-positive?
A non-positive number is a number whose value is less than or equal to 0. Create a variable num and assign it a value of any number. 
Create a variable isNonPositive and assign it the result of comparing num to zero, which will be true if num is a non-positive number, or false otherwise.

Solution
const num = -5;
const isNonPositive = num <= 0;
