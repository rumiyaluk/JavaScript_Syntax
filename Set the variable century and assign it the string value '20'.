Set the variable century and assign it the string value '20'.
Set the variable years and assign it the string value '22'.
Set the variable date and assign it the result of the merge of the century and years variables.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const redBalls = '13';
const greenBalls = '15';
const balls = redBalls + greenBalls;
Solution
const century = '20';
const years = '22';
const date = century + years;
