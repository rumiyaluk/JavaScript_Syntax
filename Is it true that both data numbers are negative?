Task
Is it true that both data numbers are negative?
You are given two numbers a and b. Determine if both numbers are negative?
calculate the variables a and b and assign them the values of state numbers. 
change the areNegative variable and give it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if a and b are negative, or false in this case.

Solution
constant = -2;
constant b = -4;
const areNegative = a < 0 && b < 0;
