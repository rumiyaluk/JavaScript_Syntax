Task
Create a variable named question and assign it the How do you do? Value. 
Create a variable length and assign it the length of the string question.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const name = 'Jonh';
const lengthName = name.length;

Solution
const question = 'How do you do?';
const length = question.length;
