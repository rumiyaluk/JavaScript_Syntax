Task
Is it true that at least one of the numbers is equal to zero?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them.
Create a variable isThereAnyZero and assign it the value of a boolean expression that will be true if a = 0 or b = 0 and false otherwise.
Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 0;
const isThereAnyZero = a === 0 || b === 0;
