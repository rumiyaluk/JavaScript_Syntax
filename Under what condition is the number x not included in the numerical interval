Task
Under what condition is the number x not included in the numerical interval [a, b]?

The number x does not belong to the numerical interval [a, b] if x < a or x > b.
Create a variable x and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. 
Create variables a and b (borders of the numeric range) and assign them the value of arbitrary numbers (a < b).
Create a notIncluded variable and assign it a boolean expression value that is true if x < a or x > b and false otherwise.

Solution
const x = 10;
const a = 4;
const b = 6;
const notIncluded = x < a || x > b;
