Task 
Is there any information about the color of the car? 
(Checking for the existence of an object property using the hasOwnProperty () method)
The object stores information about the car: const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
Determine if the object stores information about the color of the car. The result must be true or false. 
In other words, does the car object have a property named color.
To complete the task, create a car object as described above. 
Then set a variable named hasColor and set it to car.hasOwnProperty ('color'), which will be true if the car object contains a color property, and false otherwise.

Solution
const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
const hasColor = car.hasOwnProperty ('color');
