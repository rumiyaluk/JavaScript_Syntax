Task
It turns out that if you put a + sign in front of null, then from "nothing" you get the number 0!
Set the variable zero and set it to null.
Set the variable value and assign it the value of the variable zero, converted to a number using the unary plus operation.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const s = null;
const x = + s; // 0

Solution
const zero = null;
const value = + zero;
