Task
The special value undefined means "no value has been assigned."
Create a variable named name without assigning any value to it. Create a variable named login and set it to an empty string.
Create a variable named areTheSame and assign it the result of comparing the name and login variables.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let salary;
let job = '';
const isEqual = salary === job;

Solution
let undefined;
let name;
const login = '';
const areTheSame = name === login;
