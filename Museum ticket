Task
Museum ticket
Museum admission for children under 12 is $10, for children 12 and older and adults is $20. 
Determine the ticket price if the person's age is known.
Create a variable age and assign it the value of an arbitrary positive number (the person's age). 
Create a price variable. Using the if-else command, get the value of the price variable: 10 if age < 12, 20 otherwise.

Solution
const age = 15;
let price;
if (age < 12 && age < 20) {price = 10;} else {price = 20;}
