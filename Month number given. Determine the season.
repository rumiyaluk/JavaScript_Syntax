Task
Month number given. Determine the season.
Set the variable month and assign it an arbitrary integer value between 1 and 12 
(the number of the month). Set the season variable. Using a sequence of nested if-else statements, 
get the value in the season variable: "spring" (if the month is a number from 3 to 5 inclusive), "summer" 
(if the month is a number from 6 to 8 inclusive), "fall" (if the month is - a number between 9 and 11 inclusive), "winter", otherwise.
const month = 10;
let season;
if (month >= 3 && month <= 5)
{season='spring';}
else if (month >= 6 && month <= 8)
{season='summer';}
else if (month >= 9 && month <= 11)
{season='fall';}
number of the month. Determine the season.
Set the variable month and assign it an arbitrary integer value between 1 and 12 
(the number of the month). Set the season variable. Using a sequence of nested if-else statements, get the value in the season 
variable: "spring" (if the month is a number from 3 to 5 inclusive), "summer" (if the month is a number from 6 to 8 inclusive), 
"fall" (if the month is - a number between 9 and 11 inclusive), "winter", otherwise.

Solution
const month = 10;
let season;
if (month >= 3 && month <= 5)
{season='spring';}
else if (month >= 6 && month <= 8)
{season='summer';}
else if (month >= 9 && month <= 11)
{season='fall';}
