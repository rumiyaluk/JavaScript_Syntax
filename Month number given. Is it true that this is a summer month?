Task
Month number given. Is it true that this is a summer month?
set up a month variable and give it the month number (an integer between 1 and 12). 
change the isSummer variable and give it a boolean expression that will evaluate to true if the month is summer 
(i.e. the month number is greater than or equal to 6 and less than or equal to 8), and false if the case exists.

Solution
constant month = 7;
const isSummer = month >= 6 && month <= 8;
