Is it true that among the three given numbers there are at least two identical numbers?
Create variables a, b, c and assign arbitrary numbers to them.
Create a result variable and assign it the value of a boolean expression that will be true if a = b or a = c or b = c and false otherwise.

const a = 5;
const b = -3;
const c = 5;
const result = a === b || a === c || b === c;
