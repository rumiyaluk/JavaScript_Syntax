Task
Is it true that a is a multiple of b?
A is a multiple of b if the remainder of a divided by b is 0. Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary non-zero integer values to them. 
Create a variable isATimesB and assign to it the result of comparing the remainder of dividing variable a 
by variable b with zero, so that isATimesB will be true if a is a multiple of b, or false otherwise.


Solution
const a = 25;
const b = 5;
const isATimesB = a % b === 0;
