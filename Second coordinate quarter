Task
Second coordinate quarter
Given a point with coordinates (x, y). Is it true that the point is in the second coordinate quadrant? 
The point (x, y) belongs to the second coordinate quadrant if x < 0 and y > 0.
Create variables x and y and assign arbitrary number values to them. 
Create a variable isSecond and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if x < 0 and y > 0, or false otherwise.

Solution
const x = 10;
const y = 20;
const isSecond = x < 0 && y > 0;
