Task
Write down the condition "The variable has a non-numeric value"
Create a value variable and assign it a value of any type: "number", "string", or "boolean". 
Create a variable isNotANumber and assign it the condition: "the type of the value variable is not a number", i.e. write down the negation of the condition "the type of variable value is number"

Solution
const value = 'Hello';
const isNotANumber = ! (typeof value === 'number');
const isNotANumber = typeof value !== 'number';
