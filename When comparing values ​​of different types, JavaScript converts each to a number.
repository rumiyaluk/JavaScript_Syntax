Task
When comparing values ​​of different types, JavaScript converts each to a number. 
The loose equality operator == tests for value equality. If a and b have the same value and different types, 
then the result of the comparison a == b returns true. For example, '25' == 25; (true).
Create a variable named a and assign the string value '100' to it. Create a variable named b and play it with the value of the number 100. 
Create a variable named isAEqualsB and assign it the result of loose equality of variables a and b. The variable isAEqualsB must be true if a == b and false otherwise.
Solution
const a = '100';
const b = 100;
const isAEqualsB = a == b;
