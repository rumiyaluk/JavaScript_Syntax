Task
Is it true that a <b?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. 
Create a variable isALessThanB and assign it the result of comparing variables a and b so that isALessThanB will be true if a is less than b, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 20;
const b = 30;
const isALessThanB = a <b;
