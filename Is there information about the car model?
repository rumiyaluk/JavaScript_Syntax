Task 
Is there information about the car model? (Checking for the existence of an object property using the hasOwnProperty () method)
The object stores information about the car: const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
Determine if the object stores information about the vehicle model. The result must be true or false. In other words, does the car object have a property named model.
To complete the task, create a car object as described above. Then set a variable named hasModel and set it to car.hasOwnProperty ('model'), 
which will be true if the car object contains a model property, and false otherwise.

Solution
const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
const hasModel = car.hasOwnProperty ('model');
