Task
Is it true that a phone number has 11 or 12 characters?
When registering on the site, you must enter a phone number, and the length of the number must be 11 or 12 characters.
Create a phone variable and assign a value to an arbitrary string containing a phone number. 
Create a variable isPhoneCorrect and set it to a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the length of the phone string is 11 or 12, and false otherwise.

Solution
const phone = '+00712345678';
const isPhoneCorrect = phone.length === 11 || phone.length === 12;
