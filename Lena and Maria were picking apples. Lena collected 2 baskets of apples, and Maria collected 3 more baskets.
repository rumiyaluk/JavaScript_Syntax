Task
Lena and Maria were picking apples. Lena collected 2 baskets of apples, and Maria collected 3 more baskets. 
How many baskets of apples did Maria collect? How many baskets did the girls put together?
Create a variable applesLena and set it to 2.
Create a variable applesMaria and count its value.
Create a variable applesTotal and assign the sum of applesLena and applesMaria to it.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done. Adapt it to the requirements of the task.
const bananasPeter = 5;
const bananasNick = bananasPeter + 3;
const bananasTotal = bananasPeter + bananasNick;

Solution
const applesLena = 2;
const applesMaria = applesLena +3;
const applesTotal = applesLena + applesMaria;
