Task
Is it true that at least one of the numbers a, b is not zero?
Create variables a and b and assign them the values of arbitrary numbers.
Create Arenonzeros variable and assign the value of a logical expression that will be true if A is not 0 or b not equal to 0, and FALSE - otherwise.

Solution
Const a = 5;
const b = 7;
Const ArenonZeros = A! == 0 || b! == 0;
