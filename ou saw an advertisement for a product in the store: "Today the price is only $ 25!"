Task
You saw an advertisement for a product in the store: "Today the price is only $ 25!". 
The price of the item was written on the price tag as a line. But, when paying for goods at the checkout, you need to know its numerical value.
Set the variable str and assign it the string value '25'.
Set the variable price and assign it the value of str converted to a number using the unary plus operation.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const s = '10';
const x = + s;
 
 Solution
const str = '25';
const price = + str;
