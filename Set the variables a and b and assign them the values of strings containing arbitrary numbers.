Task
Set the variables a and b and assign them the values of strings containing arbitrary numbers.
Set the variable sum and assign it the result of adding these numbers, having previously converted the strings to numbers.
Those. for example, the result '4' + '7' should be 11.
Solution
const a = '4';
const b = '7';
const sum = +a + +b;
