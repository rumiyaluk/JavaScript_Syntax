Task
Set the variable p and assign it the value of the rectangle's perimeter (an arbitrary non-negative number).
Set the variable a and assign it the value of the first side of the rectangle (an arbitrary non-negative number less than p).
Set variable b, in which calculate the second side of the rectangle using the formula b = p / 2 - a.
Solution
const p = 30;
const a = 10;
const b = p / 2 - a;
