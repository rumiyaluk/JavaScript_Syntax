Task
The sides of the triangle are given a, b, c. Write a program that calculates its perimeter p.
Create variables named a, b, c and assign them the values of arbitrary positive numbers. 
Create a variable p and assign it the value of the expression to calculate the perimeter of a triangle.

Solution
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const c = 6;
const p = a + b + c;
