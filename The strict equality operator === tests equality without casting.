Task
The strict equality operator === tests equality without casting. 
If a and b have the same values ​​and types, then the comparison a === b returns true.
Create variables named a and b and assign them values ​​of arbitrary numbers. 
Create a variable named isAEqualsB and assign it the result of strict equality between a and b. 
The variable isAEqualsB must be true if a === b, and false otherwise.
Solution
const a = 10;
const b = 10;
const isAEqualsB = a === b;
