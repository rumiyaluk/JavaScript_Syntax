Task
Is it true that two given numbers have the same sign (both positive or both negative)?
You are given two numbers a and b. Determine if these numbers have the same sign (both positive or both negative).
Create variables a and b and assign them the values of arbitrary numbers (not equal to zero). 
Create a variable haveTheSameSign and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if a and b are both negative or both positive, or false otherwise.
Solution
const a = 3;
const b = 6;
const haveTheSameSign = a < 0 && b < 0 || a > 0 && b > 0;
