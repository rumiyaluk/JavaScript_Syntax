Task
Is it true that the given number is a one-digit non-negative number?
Given an arbitrary number. Determine if it is true that this is a single-valued non-negative number, i.e. a number from 0 to 9.
Create a variable number and assign it the value of an arbitrary integer. 
Create a variable isOneDigitPositive and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the number is between 0 and 9 inclusive, and false otherwise.
Solution
const number = 5;
const isOneDigitPositive = number >= 0 && number <= 9;
