Task
Set the variable str and assign it the value of a string containing a number, for example, '23'.
Set the variable num and assign it the value of the variable str converted to a number.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
Solution
const str = '23';
const num = + str;
