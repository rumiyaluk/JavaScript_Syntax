Task
Is it true that the given number is a one-digit negative number?
Given an arbitrary number. Determine if it is true that this is a one-digit negative number, i.e. a number from -9 to -1.
Create a variable number and assign it the value of an arbitrary integer. 
Create a variable isOneDigitNegative and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if the number is between -9 and -1 inclusive, and false otherwise.

Solution
const number = 3;
const isOneDigitNegative = number >= -9 && number <= -1;
