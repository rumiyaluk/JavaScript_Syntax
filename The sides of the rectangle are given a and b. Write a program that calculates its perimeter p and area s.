Task
The sides of the rectangle are given a and b. Write a program that calculates its perimeter p and area s.
Create variables named a and b and assign them the values ​​of arbitrary positive numbers. 
Create a variable p and assign it the value of the expression to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. 
Create a variable s and assign it the value of the expression for calculating the area of ​​a rectangle.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
Example
const side1 = 4;
const side2 = 9;
const square = side1 * side2;

Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const p = (a + b) * 2;
const s = a * b;
