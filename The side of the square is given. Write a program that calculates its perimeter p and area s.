Task
The side of the square is given. Write a program that calculates its perimeter p and area s.
Create a variable named a and assign an arbitrary positive number to it. Create a variable p and assign it the value of the expression to calculate the perimeter. 
Create a variable s and assign it the value of the area expression.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
Example
const number = 4;
const square = number ** 2;

Solution
const a = 5;
const p = a * 4;
const s = a ** 2;
