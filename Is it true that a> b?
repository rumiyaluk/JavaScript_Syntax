Task
Is it true that a> b?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. 
Create a variable isAGreaterThanB and assign it the result of comparing variables a and b so that isAGreaterThanB will be true if a is greater than b, or false otherwise.

Solution
const a = 40;
const b = 20;
const isAGreaterThanB = a> b;
