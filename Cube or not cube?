Task
Cube or not cube?
A cube is a regular polyhedron, each face of which is a square, i.e. this is a three-dimensional body, 
in which length = width = height. Dimensions x, y, z are given. Determine if these numbers can be the lengths of the sides of the cube. 
The numbers x, y, z can be the lengths of the sides of a cube if they are all equal.
Create variables x, y, and z and assign arbitrary positive numbers to them. 
Create a variable isCube and assign it a boolean expression that evaluates to true if x = y and y = z, or false otherwise.
Solution
const x = 5;
const y = 5;
const z = 5;
const isCube = x === y && y === z;
