Is it true that a is not equal to b?
Create variables a and b and assign arbitrary numbers to them. 
Create a variable isNotEqual and assign it the result of comparing variables a and b so that isNotEqual is true if a is not equal to b, or false otherwise.

const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const isNotEqual = a! == b;
