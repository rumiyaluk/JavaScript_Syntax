Task 
Cruise passengers
Two liners set off on a Mediterranean cruise from the port of Barcelona. The objects store information about 
the name of the liner and the number of people on board. 
Find the total number of passengers on the two liners. ship1 = {name: 'MSC Seaview', passengers: 4050,}, ship2 = {name: 'Costa Magica', passengers: 2716,}
Create objects as above and also a variable total, in which you will calculate the total number of passengers.

Solution
const ship1 = {name: 'MSC Seaview', passengers: 4050,};
const ship2 = {name: 'Costa Magica', passengers: 2716,};
const total = ship1.passengers + ship2.passengers;
