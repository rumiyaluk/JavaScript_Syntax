Task
Is it true that the given number is a multiple of 5?
A number is a multiple of 5 if the remainder of dividing that number by 5 is 0. 
Create a variable num and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. 
Create a variable isDividedBy5 and assign to it the result of comparing the remainder of num divided by 5 with zero, which will be true if num is a multiple of 5 or false otherwise.

Solution
const num = 30;
const isDividedBy5 = num %5 === 0;
