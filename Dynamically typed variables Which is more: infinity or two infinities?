Task
Dynamically typed variables
Which is more: infinity or two infinities?
Create a variable named infinity and set it to Infinity.
Create a variable named doubleInfinity and assign it twice the value of infinity.
Create a variable isEqual and assign it the result of the comparison (strict equality) between infinity and doubleInfinity.
Create a variable typeOfIsEqual and assign it a value of type isEqual.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const zero = 0;
const doubleZero = zero * 2;
const isZeroEqualsToDoubleZero = zero === doubleZero; // true
const type = typeof (isZeroEqualsToDoubleZero); // "boolean"

Solution
const infinity = Infinity;
const doubleInfinity = Infinity * 2;
const isEqual = Infinity == doubleInfinity;
const typeOfIsEqual = typeof (isEqual);
