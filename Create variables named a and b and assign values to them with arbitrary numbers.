Task
Create variables named a and b and assign values to them with arbitrary numbers. 
Create a variable named isABiggerThanB and assign the result of comparing variables a and b to it. 
The variable isABiggerThanB must be true if a> b, and false if a <= b.

Solution
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const comparison = a> b;
const isABiggerThanB = comparison;
