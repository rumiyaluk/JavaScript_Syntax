Task
Create a variable named unknown and assign it the value undefined. Create a variable called sum and assign it the value of the sum of unknown and an arbitrary number. 
Create a variable named typeOfSum and assign it a value of type sum. Check at jsbin.com what the result of adding the number and undefined is equal to. 
Create a variable named result and assign it a string containing the result of adding the number and undefined.
Here is an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
let salary;
let newSalary = salary + 100;
let type = typeof newSalary;
const result = 'NaN';
Solution
let unknown = undefined;
let sum = unknown + 50;
let typeOfSum = typeof sum;
const result = 'NaN';
