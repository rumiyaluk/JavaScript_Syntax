Task
Is it true that the given number is odd?
A number is odd if the remainder of dividing that number by 2 is not 0. 
Create a variable num and assign it the value of an arbitrary number. 
Create a variable isOdd and assign to it the result of comparing the remainder of num divided by 2 with zero, which will be true if num is an odd number, or false otherwise.

Solution
const num = 7;
const isOdd = num % 2 !== 0;
