Task
Set the variables a and b and assign them the values of strings containing arbitrary numbers.
Set the variable product and assign it the result of multiplying these numbers, first converting the strings to numbers.
Those. for example, the result '5' * '3' should be 15.
Let's give an example that is fundamentally similar to what needs to be done, but adapt it to the requirements of the task:
const num1 = '4';
const num2 = '5';
const result = + num1 * + num2;

Solution
const a = '5';
const b = '10';
const product = + a * + b;
