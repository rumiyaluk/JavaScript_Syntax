Task 
Is there any information about the year of manufacture of the car? (Checking for the existence of an object property using the hasOwnProperty () method)
The object stores information about the car: const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
Determine if the object stores information about the vehicle's year of manufacture. The result must be true or false. 
In other words, does the car object have a property named year.
To complete the task, create a car object as described above. 
Then set a variable named hasYear and assign it a value using the hasOwnProperty () method, which is true if the car object contains a year property, and false otherwise.

Solution
const car = {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2016,}
const hasYear = car.hasOwnProperty ('year');
